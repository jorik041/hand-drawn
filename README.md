# hand-drawn
Python code to create a hand drawn image from any given image using machine vision techniques:

![](resources/input/input.png) 
![](resources/output/output.png)

## Getting Started
Pull the code and run:

`python3 handDrawn.py`

 This will read in the input image: `resources/input/input.png` and output a 
 hand drawn copy to `resources/output/output.png`. Feel free to replace 
 `input.png` with your own image and see what happens`.
